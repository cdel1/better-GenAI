       "AIMessage(content='\\n Artificial intelligence (AI) has a rich and varied history that spans several decades. Here\\'s a brief overview of some of the key milestones in the field:\\n\\n1. 1950s: The Dartmouth Conference: The field of AI was founded at a conference held at Dartmouth College in 1956. Attendees included computer scientists, mathematicians, and cognitive scientists who were interested in exploring the possibilities of creating machines that could simulate human intelligence.\\n2. 1951: The Turing Test: British mathematician Alan Turing proposed a test to measure a machine\\'s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. The Turing Test has since become a benchmark for measuring the success of AI systems.\\n3. 1956: The First AI Program: Computer scientist John McCarthy created the first AI program, called the Logical Theorist, which was designed to reason and solve problems using logical deduction.\\n4. 1960s: Rule-Based Expert Systems: The development of rule-based expert systems, which used a set of rules to reason and make decisions, marked a significant milestone in the field of AI. These systems were widely used in industries such as banking and healthcare.\\n5. 1970s: Machine Learning: Machine learning, which enables machines to improve their performance on a task without explicitly being programmed, emerged as a major area of research in AI. This led to the development of algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks.\\n6. 1980s: Expert Systems: The development of expert systems, which were designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts, reached its peak in the 1980s. These systems were widely used in industries such as banking and healthcare.\\n7. 1990s: AI Winter: Despite the progress that had been made in AI research, the field experienced a decline in funding and interest in the 1990s, which became known as the \"AI winter.\"\\n8. 2000s: Resurgence of AI: The resurgence of AI began in the early 2000s, driven by advances in computing power, data storage, and machine learning algorithms. This led to the development of applications such as speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing.\\n9. 2010s: Deep Learning: The emergence of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers, has been a major driver of progress in AI. This has led to the development of applications such as self-driving cars, facial recognition, and natural language processing.\\n10. Present Day: AI is now a rapidly growing field, with applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. The field is also expanding into new areas such as robotics, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nOverall, the history of AI reflects a long-standing interest in creating machines that can simulate human intelligence. While the field has experienced periods of progress and setbacks, it continues to evolve and expand into new areas of research and application.')"

       "[Document(page_content=\"The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney ( DIZ-nee), is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate that is headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios complex in Burbank, California. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy Disney as Disney Brothers Studio; it also operated under the names Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before changing its name to the Walt Disney Company in 1986. In 1928, Disney established itself as a leader in the animation industry with the short film Steamboat Willie. The film used synchronized sound to become the first post-produced sound cartoon, and introduced Mickey Mouse, who became Disney's mascot and corporate icon.\\nAfter becoming a major success by the early 1940s, Disney diversified into live-action films, television, and theme parks in the 1950s. However, following Walt Disney's death in 1966, the company's profits, especially in the animation division, began to decline. In 1984, Disney's shareholders voted Michael Eisner as the head of the company, and which he led to the decline's reversal and the overwhelmingly successful period known as the Disney Renaissance from 1989 to 1999. In 2005, under new CEO Bob Iger, the company started to expand and acquire other corporations. In 2020, Bob Chapek became the head of Disney after Iger's retirement. However, Chapek was ousted in 2022 and Iger was reinstated as CEO.The company is known for its film studio division Walt Disney Studios, which includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, 20th Century Animation, and Searchlight Pictures. Disney's other main business units include divisions in television, broadcasting, streaming media, theme park resorts, consumer products, publishing, and international operations. Through these divisions, Disney owns and operates the ABC broadcast network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, FX, and National Geographic; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Disney+, Star+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Hotstar; and Disney Experiences, which includes several theme parks, resort hotels, and cruise lines around the world.\\nDisney is one of the biggest and best-known companies in the world, and has been ranked number 53 on the 2022 Fortune 500 list of biggest companies in the United States by revenue. Since its founding, the company has won 135 Academy Awards, 26 of which have been awarded to Walt.

Iwerks and Disney went on to create several short films at the studio. The final one, created in 1923, was entitled Alice's Wonderland and depicted child actor Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters. Before the film was released, Laugh-O-Gram Studio went bankrupt, and Disney moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, to join his brother Roy O. Disney, who had tuberculosis. However, the film became a hit after Disney contacted New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler, who purchased it.

Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy Disney as Disney Brothers Studio; it also operated under the names Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before changing its name to the Walt Disney Company in 1986. In 1928, Disney established itself as a leader in the animation industry with the short film Steamboat Willie. The film used synchronized sound to become the first post-produced sound cartoon, and introduced Mickey Mouse, who became Disney's mascot and corporate icon.\\nAfter becoming a major success by the early 1940s, Disney diversified into live-action films, television, and theme parks in the 1950s. However, following Walt Disney's death in 1966, the company's profits, especially in the animation division, began to decline. In 1984, Disney's shareholders voted Michael Eisner as the head of the company, and which he led to the decline's reversal and the overwhelmingly successful period known as the Disney Renaissance from 1989 to 1999. In 2005, under new CEO Bob Iger, the company started to expand and acquire other corporations. In 2020, Bob Chapek became the head of Disney after Iger's retirement. However, Chapek was ousted in 2022 and Iger was reinstated as CEO.The company is known for its film studio division Walt Disney Studios, which includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, 20th Century Animation, and Searchlight Pictures. Disney's other main business units include divisions in television, broadcasting, streaming media, theme park resorts, consumer products, publishing, and international operations. Through these divisions, Disney owns and operates the ABC broadcast network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, FX, and National Geographic; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Disney+, Star+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Hotstar; and Disney Experiences, which includes several theme parks, resort hotels, and cruise lines around the world.\\nDisney is one of the biggest and best-known companies in the world, and has been ranked number 53 on the 2022 Fortune 500 list of biggest companies in the United States by revenue.
