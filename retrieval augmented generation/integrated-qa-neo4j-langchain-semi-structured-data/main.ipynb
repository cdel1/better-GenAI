       "'5.1. Text\\n\\n5.1.1. Academic Benchmarks\\n\\nWe compare Gemini Pro and Ultra to a suite of external LLMs and our previous best model PaLM 2 across a series of text-based academic benchmarks covering reasoning, reading comprehension, STEM, and coding. We report these results in Table 2. Broadly, we find that the performance of Gemini Pro outperforms inference-optimized models such as GPT-3.5 and performs comparably with several of the most capable models available, and Gemini Ultra outperforms all current models. In this section, we examine some of these findings.\\n\\nOn MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), Gemini Ultra can outperform all existing models, achieving an accuracy of 90.04%. MMLU is a holistic exam benchmark, which measures knowledge across a set of 57 subjects. Human expert performance is gauged at 89.8% by the benchmark authors, and Gemini Ultra is the first model to exceed this threshold, with the prior state-of-the-art result at 86.4%. Achieving high performance requires specialist knowledge across many domains (e.g. law, biology, history, etc.), alongside reading comprehension and reasoning. We find Gemini Ultra achieves highest accuracy when used in combination with a chain-of-thought prompting approach (Wei et al., 2022) that accounts for model uncertainty. The model produces a chain of thought with k samples, for example 8 or 32. If there is a consensus above a preset threshold (selected based on the validation split), it selects this answer, otherwise it reverts to a greedy sample based on maximum likelihood choice without chain of thought. We refer the reader to appendix for a detailed breakdown of how this approach compares with only chain-of-thought prompting or only greedy sampling.\\n\\nIn mathematics, a field commonly used to benchmark the analytical capabilities of models, Gemini Ultra shows strong performance on both elementary exams and competition-grade problem sets. For the grade-school math benchmark, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), we find Gemini Ultra reaches 94.4% accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022) compared to the previous best accuracy of 92% with the same prompting technique. Similar positive trends are observed in increased difficulty math problems drawn from middle- and high-school math competitions (MATH benchmark), with the Gemini Ultra model outperforming all competitor models, reaching 53.2% using 4-shot prompting. The model also outperforms the state of the art on even harder tasks derived from American Mathematical Competitions (150 questions from 2022 and 2023). Smaller models perform poorly on this challenging task scoring close to random, but Gemini Ultra can solve 32% of the questions, compared to the 30% solve rate for GPT-4.\\n\\nGemini Ultra also excels in coding, a popular use case of current LLMs. We evaluate the model on many conventional and internal benchmarks and also measure its performance as part of more complex reasoning systems such as AlphaCode 2 (see section 5.1.7 on complex reasoning systems). For example, on HumanEval, a standard code-completion benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) mapping function descriptions to Python implementations, instruction-tuned Gemini Ultra correctly implements 74.4% of problems. On a new held-out evaluation benchmark for python code generation tasks, Natural2Code, where we ensure no web leakage, Gemini Ultra achieves the highest score of 74.9%.\\n\\nGemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models'"
